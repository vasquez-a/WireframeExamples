Since my experience is in UI development, this folder provides some examples of wireframes I have previously developed. This folder contains some wireframes from two separate projects done for coursework. More materials can be provided upon request.



BLUEBEAN

A project from a Brand Identity class, where I came up with a brand design for a fictional bookstore-cafe from scratch and developed its assets; specifically this folder contains the wireframes for the hypothetical website of my fictional brand. Because the class was a graphic design class and not a web or software development class, the wireframes are as far as this particular project goes. Unlike most of my projects, I had to comply to existing brand standards (that yes, were made by myself, but had been set in stone weeks before the development of these wireframes). The assets (like the logo) were all designed by myself and put together using Figma. 


SOCIAL SCORER

A project done for a software development class. The idea behind Social Scorer was exploring the hypothetical design and implementation of an application that allows users to give other users a positive or negative "social score" depending on their actions. It was a tongue-in-cheek project that (thankfully) was never meant to be seriously deployed, but the nature of the project and the fact that I was the only frontend developer/UI designer meant that I had free reign to decide the aesthetics of the project. I enjoyed the challenge of balancing the dystopian imagery with a practical interface. Like the previous project, the wireframes were designed using Figma.
